# Security Policy

## 🔒 Security Commitment

We take the security of our multi-cloud Kubernetes platform seriously. This document outlines our security practices, how to report vulnerabilities, and our response process.

## 🛡️ Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2.x.x   | ✅ |
| 1.8.x   | ✅ |
| 1.7.x   | ✅ |
| < 1.7   | ❌ |

## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

### Where to Report

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please use one of the following methods:

1. **Email**: Send details to `security@your-domain.com`
2. **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use the [private vulnerability reporting feature](https://github.com/animesh-mukherjee-devops/terraform-multicloud-kubernetes/security/advisories/new)
3. **Encrypted Communication**: Use our PGP key for sensitive reports

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential security impact and affected components
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- **Environment**: Affected cloud providers, Terraform versions, etc.
- **Proof of Concept**: Code or configuration demonstrating the vulnerability
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for remediation

### Response Timeline

We commit to the following response timeline:

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours of report receipt
- **Status Update**: Within 72 hours with initial assessment
- **Resolution**: Security fixes within 7-14 days depending on severity
- **Public Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure 30-90 days after fix

## 🔍 Security Features

### Infrastructure Security

- **Encrypted State Storage**: All Terraform state is encrypted at rest
- **Secret Management**: No hardcoded secrets, cloud-native secret stores
- **Network Security**: Default deny network policies, VPC isolation
- **Access Control**: RBAC with least-privilege principles
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails for all cluster activities

### Code Security

- **Static Analysis**: Automated security scanning with Checkov and tfsec
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular updates and vulnerability assessments
- **Supply Chain Security**: Signed commits and verified providers
- **Secret Scanning**: Automated detection of accidentally committed secrets

### Operational Security

- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Required for all administrative access
- **Regular Updates**: Automated security updates for managed components
- **Incident Response**: Documented procedures for security incidents
- **Backup and Recovery**: Encrypted backups with tested recovery procedures

## 🔐 Security Hardening Guide

### Cluster Hardening

```yaml
# Pod Security Standards (automatically applied)
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: production
  labels:
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: restricted
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/audit: restricted
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/warn: restricted
```

### Network Security

```yaml
# Default deny network policy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: default-deny-all
  namespace: production
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
```

### RBAC Configuration

```yaml
# Least-privilege service account
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: app-service-account
  namespace: production
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: app-role
  namespace: production
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods", "services"]
  verbs: ["get", "list"]
```

## 🛠️ Security Tools and Scanning

### Automated Security Scanning

Our CI/CD pipeline includes:

- **Checkov**: Infrastructure as Code security scanning
- **tfsec**: Terraform-specific security analysis
- **Trivy**: Container image vulnerability scanning
- **KICS**: Infrastructure security scanning
- **Semgrep**: Static application security testing

### Manual Security Testing

We recommend regular manual security assessments:

```bash
# Run security scans locally
make security-scan

# Check for misconfigurations
checkov -d terraform/ --framework terraform

# Scan Terraform files
tfsec terraform/

# Kubernetes security baseline
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/pod-security-webhook/main/policies/baseline.yaml
```

## 🚨 Known Security Considerations

### Cloud Provider Specific

#### DigitalOcean
- **Network Security**: Limited network security group options
- **Encryption**: Enable encryption in transit for all communications
- **Access**: Use API tokens with minimal required scopes

#### Azure
- **Identity**: Integrate with Azure Active Directory for enhanced security
- **Networking**: Use Azure Network Security Groups and Application Security Groups
- **Secrets**: Integrate with Azure Key Vault for secret management

#### AWS
- **IAM**: Use least-privilege IAM roles and policies
- **VPC**: Implement proper VPC security groups and NACLs
- **Encryption**: Enable encryption at rest for EBS volumes and secrets

### Kubernetes Security

- **Container Security**: Use distroless or minimal base images
- **Runtime Security**: Implement runtime protection with tools like Falco
- **Image Scanning**: Scan all container images for vulnerabilities
- **Network Policies**: Implement micro-segmentation with network policies

## 📋 Security Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
